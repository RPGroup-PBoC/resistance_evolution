  abstract = {A simple technique has been devised that allows direct plate selection of tetracycline-sensitive clones from a predominantly tetracycline-resistant population. The technique is especially useful in genetic methodologies based on the use of tetracycline resistance transposons, such as Tn10. Potential uses of the method include selection of deletion mutants, fine-structure mapping, generalized mapping, construction of multiply marked strains, elimination of tetracycline resistance transposons and plasmids, and cloning. The technique is based on our finding that tetracycline-resistant cells are hypersensitive to lipophilic chelating agents, such as fusaric acid. This finding supports the contention that certain metal ions critically facilitate tetracycline uptake and leads us to suggest possible molecular mechanisms for tetracycline resistance.},

Elucidating these relations is important both for understanding the physiological functions of endogenous genetic circuits and for designing robust synthetic systems. We describe a phenomenological study that reveals intrinsic constraints governing the allocation of resources toward protein synthesis and other aspects of cell growth. A theory incorporating these constraints can accurately predict how cell proliferation and gene expression affect one another, quantitatively accounting for the effect of translation-inhibiting antibiotics on gene expression and the effect of gratuitous protein expression on cell growth. The use of such empirical relations, analogous to phenomenological laws, may facilitate our understanding and manipulation of complex biological systems before underlying regulatory circuits are elucidated.},

The tetA and sacB genes are contained in a DNA cassette and confer a novel dual counter-selection system. Expression of tetA confers bacterial resistance to tetracycline (TcR) and also causes sensitivity to the lipophillic chelator fusaric acid; sacB causes sensitivity to sucrose. These two genes are introduced as a joint DNA cassette into Escherichia coli by selection for TcR. A medium containing both fusaric acid and sucrose has been developed, in which, coexpression of tetA-sacB is orders of magnitude more sensitive as a counter-selection agent than either gene alone. In conjunction with the homologous recombination methods of recombineering and P1 transduction, this powerful system has been used to select changes in the bacterial genome that cannot be directly detected by other counter-selection systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Oxford University Press.},

  abstract = {Phenomenological relations such as Ohm's or Fourier's law have a venerable history in physics but are still scarce in biology. This situation restrains predictive theory. Here, we build on bacterial “growth laws,” which capture physiological feedback between translation and cell growth, to construct a minimal biophysical model for the combined action of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Our model predicts drug interactions like antagonism or synergy solely from responses to individual drugs. We provide analytical results for limiting cases, which agree well with numerical results. We systematically refine the model by including direct physical interactions of different antibiotics on the ribosome. In a limiting case, our model provides a mechanistic underpinning for recent predictions of higher-order interactions that were derived using entropy maximization. We further refine the model to include the effects of antibiotics that mimic starvation and the presence of resistance genes. We describe the impact of a starvation-mimicking antibiotic on drug interactions analytically and verify it experimentally. Our extended model suggests a change in the type of drug interaction that depends on the strength of resistance, which challenges established rescaling paradigms. We experimentally show that the presence of unregulated resistance genes can lead to altered drug interaction, which agrees with the prediction of the model. While minimal, the model is readily adaptable and opens the door to predicting interactions of second and higher-order in a broad range of biological systems.},

As I'm trying to find the right range of NiCl2 acting as a negative selection agent I came across this reference from the Kuhlman paper where they use tetA as a negative selection cassette.
This paper was apparently the first one to show that NiCl2 can be harmful to cells harvesting the tetA gene. Furthermore they show that the mechanism must be that cells with tetA import more NiCl2 than wt cells since they use radioactive NiCl2 and see that the import level is higher in cells with the pump.
The paper is short, and I wouldn't call it "a classic." But it gave me the information I was looking for},

  abstract      = {Bacterial growth environment strongly influences the efficacy of antibiotic treatment, with slow growth often being associated with decreased susceptibility. Yet in many cases, the connection between antibiotic susceptibility and pathogen physiology remains unclear. We show that for ribosome-targeting antibiotics acting on Escherichia coli, a complex interplay exists between physiology and antibiotic action; for some antibiotics within this class, faster growth indeed increases susceptibility, but for other antibiotics, the opposite is true. Remarkably, these observations can be explained by a simple mathematical model that combines drug transport and binding with physiological constraints. Our model reveals that growth-dependent susceptibility is controlled by a single parameter characterizing the ‘reversibility' of ribosome-targeting antibiotic transport and binding. This parameter provides a spectrum classification of antibiotic growth-dependent efficacy that appears to correspond at its extremes to existing binary classification schemes. In these limits, the model predicts universal, parameter-free limiting forms for growth inhibition curves. The model also leads to nontrivial predictions for the drug susceptibility of a translation mutant strain of E. coli, which we verify experimentally. Drug action and bacterial metabolism are mechanistically complex; nevertheless, this study illustrates how coarse-grained models can be used to integrate pathogen physiology into drug design and treatment strategies.},

  abstract  = {Bacterial resistance mechanisms must cope with transient fast-changing conditions. These systems are often repressed in the absence of the drug, and it is unclear how their regulation can provide a quick response when challenged. Here, we focus on the tet operon, which provides resistance to tetracycline through efflux pump TetA. We show that, somewhat counterintuitively, prompt expression of the TetA repressor TetR is key for cellular survival upon abrupt drug exposure. Tracking individual cells upon exposure, we find that differences in the rate of TetR elevation result in three distinct cell fates: recovery (high rate), death due to excess TetA (intermediate rate), and death from the drug (low rate). A surge of TetR expression optimizes the response by allowing sensitive detection of both the initial rise and the later decline of intracellular drug, avoiding an undesirable overshoot in TetA expression. These results show how regulatory circuits of resistance genes have evolved for optimized dynamics. Schultz et al. show that the tet resistance mechanism optimizes the dynamics of the response by quickly elevating expression of repressor TetR upon antibiotic exposure. This assures sensitivity not only to the presence of the drug but also to a decline in drug concentration, thus preventing unnecessary and toxic expression of the efflux pump, TetA.},

  abstract = {We postulate that the inhibition of growth and low rates of mortality of bacteria exposed to ribosome-binding antibiotics deemed bacteriostatic can be attributed almost uniquely to these drugs reducing the number of ribosomes contributing to protein synthesis, i.e., the number of effective ribosomes. We tested this hypothesis with Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and constructs that had been deleted for 1 to 6 of the 7 rRNA ( rrn ) operons. In the absence of antibiotics, constructs with fewer rrn operons have lower maximum growth rates and longer lag phases than those with more ribosomal operons. In the presence of the ribosome-binding “bacteriostatic” antibiotics tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and azithromycin, E. coli strains with 1 and 2 rrn operons are killed at a substantially higher rate than those with more rrn operons. This increase in the susceptibility of E. coli with fewer rrn operons to killing by ribosome-targeting bacteriostatic antibiotics is not reflected in their greater sensitivity to killing by the bactericidal antibiotic ciprofloxacin, which does not target ribosomes, but also to killing by gentamicin, which does. Finally, when such strains are exposed to these ribosome-targeting bacteriostatic antibiotics, the time before these bacteria start to grow again when the drugs are removed, referred to as the post-antibiotic effect (PAE), is markedly greater for constructs with fewer rrn operons than for those with more rrn operons. We interpret the results of these other experiments reported here as support for the hypothesis that the reduction in the effective number of ribosomes due to binding to these structures provides a sufficient explanation for the action of bacteriostatic antibiotics that target these structures.},

@article{Deris2013,
  abstract = {To predict the emergence of antibiotic resistance, quantitative relations must be established between the fitness of drug-resistant organisms and the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance. These relations are often unknown and may depend on the state of bacterial growth. To bridge this gap, we have investigated Escherichia coli strains expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics. We show that resistance expression and drug inhibition are linked in a positive feedback loop arising from an innate, global effect of drug-inhibited growth on gene expression. A quantitative model of bacterial growth based on this innate feedback accurately predicts the rich phenomena observed: a plateau-shaped fitness landscape, with an abrupt drop in the growth rates of cultures at a threshold drug concentration, and the coexistence of growing and nongrowing populations, that is, growth bistability, below the threshold.},
  annote   = {This is a truly remarkable paper that Tom pointed me to. It is the missing link that I was looking for to make sense of our theoretical model having to do with fitness as a function of the expression of an antibiotic resistance.
The paper is based on a very curious observation: When we compare two strains, the WT, and one with an antibiotic resistance (specific for translation inhibitors) we find that WT cells growth seems for the most part unaffected until the antibiotic concentration reaches the MIC (a quick drop in fitness). This is in contrast with the strain with the resistance gene that shows a smoother decrement in growth rate.
￼
The task of the paper is to understand why WT cells have this abrupt fitness fall, while the resistance take longer to die. One of the things they discover through clever experiments is that for the cells with antibiotic resistance, the growth rate distribution is bimodal. A fraction of the population ceases growth, while the other ones keep growing.
￼
￼
As one would expect form Terry's group, they develop a quantitative model to try to understand this observation. I won't write down that many details here since I will actually work through the entire model on my Notability notes, but it has to do with growth rate-dependent translation rates. Basically, the drug inhibits cellular growth which is directly related to the antibiotic resistance expression. So the more drug, the less expression of the resistance, and the less ability to survive the drug.
There is a bunch of fun quantitative insights that come from this model. Again, I will work through the model with every factor of two because this is the key that we need to understand our tetA experiments.
Conclusion
Super fun, super insightful, and super rigorous paper from Terry's group. That guy is truly a master of bacterial physiology.},
