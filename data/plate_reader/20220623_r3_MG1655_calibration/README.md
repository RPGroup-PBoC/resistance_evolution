# 2021-01-21 Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This is the first run of a series of plates trying to determine potential differences in growth rate across our new 96 well plates.

## Strain Information

| Plasmid | Genotype | Host Strain | Shorthand |
| :------ | :------- | ----------: | --------: |

## Notes & Observations
For this experiment we used new 96-well plates from Eppendorf that are build with an extra space outside the outer wells that can be filled with water to prevent evaporation in the wells on the outside.
