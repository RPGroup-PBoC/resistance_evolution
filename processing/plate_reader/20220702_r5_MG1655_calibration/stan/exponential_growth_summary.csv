# Inference for Stan model: exponential_growth_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (0.045, 0.045, 0.048, 0.037) seconds, 0.17 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.053, 0.054, 0.052, 0.054) seconds, 0.21 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
