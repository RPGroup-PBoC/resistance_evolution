# Inference for Stan model: exponential_growth_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (0.086, 0.087, 0.079, 0.076) seconds, 0.33 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.079, 0.075, 0.088, 0.085) seconds, 0.33 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
